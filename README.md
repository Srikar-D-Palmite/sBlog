Blogging website

sBlog is a blogging website written in Python's Django web framework for back-end computing and database management and HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript for the front-end.

view their own and other users' blog posts, edit their own posts, delete their own posts, comment on other users' posts, search for other users and blog posts, and more!

2. Ensure you have Python and Django installed
