Blogging website

sBlog is a blogging website written in Python's Django web framework for back-end computing and database management and HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript for the front-end.

Users have the ability to create an account (register), log in, view the latest blog posts on the home page, create blog posts of their own in plain text, 
view their own and other users' blog posts, edit their own posts, delete their own posts, comment on other users' posts, search for other users and blog posts, and more!

This website was created within 10 days as a miniproject by [Srikar Tadeparti](https://github.com/Srikar-D-Palmite).
